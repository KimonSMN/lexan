Builders Serialize the Hash Table Data:

Convert each entry in the hash table into a standardized format.
For example, for each word-count pair, you might send:
    The length of the word (as an integer in network byte order).
    The word itself (as a string of bytes).
    The count (as an integer in network byte order).

Send the Serialized Data Through a Pipe or Named Pipe:

    Each builder will write its serialized data to a pipe that connects to the root process.
    You can use either anonymous pipes (if the processes are related) or named pipes (FIFOs) if they are unrelated.

Root Process Reads and Deserializes the Data:

    The root process reads the data sent by each builder.
    It deserializes the data, reconstructing the word-count pairs.
    It then aggregates the counts, combining the data from all builders.

Root Process Produces the Final Output:

    After collecting and aggregating data from all builders, the root process can perform operations such as:
        Sorting the words by frequency.
        Selecting the top K words.
        Writing the results to the output file.
